      Where wilds, immeasurably spread,

    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      "Forbear, my son," the hermit cries,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "To tempt the dangerous gloom;

    <p>
      For yonder faithless phantom flies

      To lure thee to thy doom.

      My rushy couch and frugal fare,

      Taught by that Power that pities me,

      "But from the mountain's grassy side
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A guiltless feast I bring;
    </p>
    <p>
      A scrip with herbs and fruits supplied,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And water from the spring.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, pilgrim, turn, thy cares forego;

    <p class="indent5">
      All earth-born cares are wrong:

    <p>
      Man wants but little here below,

    <p class="indent5">
      His gentle accents fell:
    </p>
    <p>
      The modest stranger lowly bends,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And follows to the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Far in a wilderness obscure
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The lonely mansion lay&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A refuge to the neighbouring poor,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And strangers led astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No stores beneath its humble thatch
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Required a master's care;

      The wicket, opening with a latch,

      Received the harmless pair.

    </p>
    <p>
      And now, when busy crowds retire
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To take their evening rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit trimmed his little fire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And cheered his pensive guest:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And spread his vegetable store,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And gaily pressed and smiled;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, skilled in legendary lore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The ling'ring hours beguiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Around, in sympathetic mirth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Its tricks the kitten tries,

    <p>
      The cricket chirrups on the hearth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The crackling faggot flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing could a charm impart
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To soothe the stranger's woe;
    </p>
    <p>
      For grief was heavy at his heart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And tears began to flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His rising cares the hermit spied,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With answering care opprest:
    </p>
    <p>
      And "Whence, unhappy youth," he cried,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "The sorrows of thy breast?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "From better habitations spurn'd,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Reluctant dost thou rove?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or unregarded love?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! the joys that fortune brings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are trifling, and decay;
    </p>
    <p>
      And those who prize the paltry things,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      More trifling still than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is friendship but a name,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A charm that lulls to sleep,
    </p>
    <p>
      A shade that follows wealth or fame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But leaves the wretch to weep?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And love is still an emptier sound,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The modern fair one's jest;
    </p>
    <p>
      On earth unseen, or only found
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To warm the turtle's nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, fond youth, thy sorrows hush,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And spurn the sex," he said;
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      He soon replied, "I do admire

      Of womankind but one,

    <p>
      And you are she, my dearest dear,

      Quoth Mrs Gilpin, "That's well said;

    <p class="indent5">
      And for that wine is dear,
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be furnished with our own,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      O'erjoyed was he to find,

      That though on pleasure she was bent,

      She had a frugal mind.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, the chaise was brought,

      To drive up to the door, lest all

    <p class="indent5">
      Should say that she was proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where they did all get in;
    </p>
    <p>
      Six precious souls, and all agog
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To dash through thick and thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were never folks so glad,
    </p>
    <p>
      The stones did rattle underneath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As if Cheapside were mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      John Gilpin at his horse's side
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Seized fast the flowing mane,
    </p>
    <p>
      And up he got, in haste to ride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But soon came down again;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His journey to begin,
    </p>
    <p>
      When, turning round his head, he saw
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Three customers come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So down he came; for loss of time,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Although it grieved him sore,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Would trouble him much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas long before the customers
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were suited to their mind,
    </p>
    <p>
      When Betty screaming came downstairs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "The wine is left behind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My leathern belt likewise,
    </p>
    <p>
      In which I bear my trusty sword
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When I do exercise."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had two stone bottles found,
    </p>
    <p>
      To hold the liquor that she loved,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And keep it safe and sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Each bottle had a curling ear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through which the belt he drew,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hung a bottle on each side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To make his balance true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then over all, that he might be
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Equipped from top to toe,
    </p>
    <p>
      His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He manfully did throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now see him mounted once again
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon his nimble steed,
    </p>
    <p>
      Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With caution and good heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But finding soon a smoother road
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Beneath his well-shod feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      The snorting beast began to trot,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Which galled him in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So, "Fair and softly!" John he cried,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But John he cried in vain;
    </p>
    <p>
      That trot became a gallop soon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In spite of curb and rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So stooping down, as needs he must
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who cannot sit upright,
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped the mane with both his hands,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And eke with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse, who never in that sort
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had handled been before,
    </p>
    <p>
      What thing upon his back had got
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did wonder more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Away went hat and wig;
    </p>
    <p>
      He little dreamt, when he set out,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of running such a rig.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like streamer long and gay,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till, loop and button failing both,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      At last it flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then might all people well discern
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The bottles he had slung;
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle swinging at each side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As hath been said or sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Up flew the windows all;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p class="indent5">
      As loud as he could bawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His fame soon spread around;
    </p>
    <p>
      "He carries weight! he rides a race!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Tis for a thousand pound!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And still as fast as he drew near,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas wonderful to view,
    </p>
    <p>
      How in a trice the turnpike-men
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Their gates wide open threw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he went bowing down
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His reeking head full low,
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottles twain behind his back
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were shattered at a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Down ran the wine into the road,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Most piteous to be seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which made the horse's flanks to smoke
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As they had basted been.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But still he seemed to carry weight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With leathern girdle braced;
    </p>
    <p>
      For all might see the bottle-necks
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Still dangling at his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus all through merry Islington
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      These gambols he did play,
    </p>
    <p>
      Until he came unto the Wash
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of Edmonton so gay;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And there he threw the Wash about
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On both sides of the way,
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like unto a trundling mop,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or a wild goose at play.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At Edmonton his loving wife
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From the balcony spied
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tender husband, wondering much
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To see how he did ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They all at once did cry;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Said Gilpin&mdash;"So am I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet his horse was not a whit
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Inclined to tarry there!
    </p>
    <p>
      For why?&mdash;his owner had a house
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Full ten miles off, at Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So like an arrow swift he flew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shot by an archer strong;
    </p>
    <p>
      So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The middle of my song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sore against his will,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till at his friend the calender's

      His horse at last stood still.

    <p>
      The calender, amazed to see
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His neighbour in such trim,
    </p>
    <p>
      Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And thus accosted him:

      Or why you come at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And loved a timely joke;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus unto the calender
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In merry guise he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came because your horse would come:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, if I well forebode,
    </p>
    <p>
      My hat and wig will soon be here,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They are upon the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The calender, right glad to find
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His friend in merry pin,
    </p>
    <p>
      Returned him not a single word,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But to the house went in;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A wig that flowed behind,
    </p>
    <p>
      A hat not much the worse for wear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Each comely in his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He held them up, and in his turn
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Thus showed his ready wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head is twice as big as yours,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They therefore needs must fit."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But let me scrape the dirt away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That hangs upon your face;
    </p>
    <p>
      And stop and eat, for well you may
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Be in a hungry case."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all the world would stare
    </p>
    <p>
      If wife should dine at Edmonton,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And I should dine at Ware."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So turning to his horse, he said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I am in haste to dine;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You shall go back for mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For which he paid full dear;
    </p>
    <p>
      For while he spake, a braying ass
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did sing most loud and clear;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat his horse did snort, as he
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had heard a lion roar,
    </p>
    <p>
      And galloped off with all his might,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he had done before
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Gilpin, and away
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost them sooner than at first,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For why?&mdash;they were too big.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her husband posting down
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the country far away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She pulled out half-a-crown;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus unto the youth she said
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That drove them to the "Bell,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This shall be yours when you bring back
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My husband safe and well."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth did ride, and soon did meet
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      John coming back amain;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      By catching at his rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But not performing what he meant,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And gladly would have done,
    </p>
    <p>
      The frighted steed he frighted more,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And made him faster run.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Gilpin, and away
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Went postboy at his heels,
    </p>
    <p>
      The postboy's horse right glad to miss
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The lumbering of the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Six gentlemen upon the road,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
    </p>
    <p>
      With postboy scampering in the rear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They raised the hue and cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop thief! stop thief!&mdash;a highwayman!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Not one of them was mute;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all and each that passed that way
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did join in the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the turnpike-gates again
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Flew open in short space;
    </p>
    <p>
      The toll-men thinking, as before,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That Gilpin rode a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he did, and won it too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For he got first to town;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor stopped till where he had got up,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He did again get down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us sing, Long live the King,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And Gilpin, long live he!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he next doth ride abroad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      May I be there to see!

      FAIR ELEANOR
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he bell struck
      one, and shook the silent tower;
    </p>
    <p>
      The graves give up their dead: fair Eleanor
    </p>
    <p>
      Walked by the castle gate, and looked in;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hollow groan ran through the dreary vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrieked aloud, and sunk upon the steps,
    </p>
    <p>
      On the cold stone her pale cheek. Sickly smells
    </p>
    <p>
      Of death issue as from a sepulchre.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all is silent but the sighing vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Chill death withdraws his hand, and she revives;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed she finds herself upon her feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like a ghost, through narrow passages
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones
    </p>
    <p>
      And grinning skulls, and corruptible death

    <p>
      Wrapt in his shroud; and now fancies she hears
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, no fancy but reality
    </p>
    <p>
      Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one that fled, approaches.&mdash;Ellen stood,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretch approaches, crying, "The deed is done!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my life&mdash;send it to Eleanor&mdash;:
    </p>
    <p>
      He's dead, and howling after me for blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this," he cried: and thrust into her arms
    </p>
    <p>
      A wet napkin, wrapt about; then rushed
    </p>
    <p>
      Past, howling. She received into her arms
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale death, and followed on the wings of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed swift through the outer gate; the wretch
    </p>
    <p>
      Howling, leaped o'er the wall into the moat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen passed the bridge,
    </p>
    <p>
      And heard a gloomy voice cry, "Is it done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the deer wounded, Ellen flew over
    </p>
    <p>
      The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly
    </p>
    <p>
      By night, destruction flies, and strikes in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled from fear, till at her house arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her maids await her; on her bed she falls,
    </p>
    <p>
      That bed of joy where erst her lord hath pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah woman's fear!" she cried, "Ah cursed duke!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah my dear lord! Ah wretched Eleanor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord was like a flower upon the brows
    </p>
    <p>
      Of lusty May! Ah life as frail as flower!
    </p>
    <p>
      O ghastly Death! withdraw thy cruel hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seek'st thou that flower to deck thy horrid temples?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord was like a star in highest heaven
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord was like the opening eyes of day,
    </p>
    <p>
      When western winds creep softly oer the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is darkened; like the summer's noon
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down;
    </p>
    <p>
      The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves,'
    </p>
    <p>
      O Eleanor, weak woman, filled with woe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus having spoke, she raised up her head,
    </p>
    <p>
      And saw the bloody napkin by her side,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold
    </p>
    <p>
      More terrified, saw it unfold itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed; the bloody cloth unfolds,
    </p>
    <p>
      Disclosing to her sight the murdered head
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted
    </p>
    <p>
      With gory blood; it groaned, and thus it spake:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Eleanor, behold thy husband's head,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who sleeping on the stones of yonder tower,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was reft of life by the accursed duke:
    </p>
    <p>
      A hired villain turned my sleep to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Eleanor, beware the cursed duke;
    </p>
    <p>
      O give him not thy hand, now I am dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night,
    </p>
    <p>
      Hired a villain to bereave my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffened to stone;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the gory head up in her arms;
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the pale lips; she had no tears to shed;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged it to her breast, and groaned her last.

      Was brought to the court of our good Scottish king,

      Craigdarroch, so famous for wit, worth, and law;
    </p>
    <p>
      And trusty Glenriddel, so skill'd in old coins;
    </p>
    <p>
      And gallant Sir Robert, deep-read in old wines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Craigdarroch began, with a tongue smooth as oil,
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiring Glenriddel to yield up the spoil;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or else he would muster the heads of the clan,
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more, in claret, try which was the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the gods of the ancients!" Glenriddel replies,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I surrender so glorious a prize,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More,
    </p>
    <p>
      And bumper his horn with him twenty times oer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert, a soldier, no speech would pretend,
    </p>
    <p>
      But he ne'er turn'd his back on his foe&mdash;or his friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Said, Toss down the whistle, the prize of the field,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, knee-deep in claret, he'd die ere he'd yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To the board of Glenriddel our heroes repair,
    </p>
    <p>
      So noted for drowning of sorrow and care;
    </p>
    <p>
      But for wine and for welcome not more known to fame
    </p>
    <p>
      Than the sense, wit, and taste of a sweet lovely dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A bard was selected to witness the fray,
    </p>
    <p>
      And tell future ages the feats of the day;
    </p>
    <p>
      A bard who detested all sadness and spleen,
    </p>
    <p>
      And wish'd that Parnassus a vineyard had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner being over, the claret they ply,
    </p>
    <p>
      And every new cork is a new spring of joy;

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright Phoebus ne'er witness'd so joyous a core,
    </p>
    <p>
      And vow'd that to leave them he was quite forlorn,

    <p>
      Till Cynthia hinted he'd see them next morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Six bottles apiece had well wore out the night,
    </p>
    <p>
      When gallant Sir Robert, to finish the fight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn'd o'er in one bumper a bottle of red,
    </p>
    <p>
      And swore 'twas the way that their ancestors did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then worthy Glenriddel, so cautious and sage,
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer the warfare ungodly would wage;
    </p>
    <p>
      A high ruling-elder to wallow in wine!
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the foul business to folks less divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end;
    </p>
    <p>
      But who can with Fate and quart-bumpers contend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Fate said&mdash;A hero shall perish in light;
    </p>
    <p>
      So up rose bright Phoebus&mdash;and down fell the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next up rose our bard, like a prophet in drink:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Craigdarroch, thou'll soar when creation shall sink!
    </p>
    <p>
      But if thou wouldst flourish immortal in rhyme,
    </p>
    <p>
      Come&mdash;one bottle more&mdash;and have at the sublime!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thy line, that have struggled for Freedom with Bruce,

    <p>
      So thine be the laurel, and mine be the bay;

      THE LAIRD O' COCKPEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he laird o'
      Cockpen, he's proud an' he's great,
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind is ta'en up wi' things o' the State;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted a wife, his braw house to keep,
    </p>
    <p>
      But favour wi' wooin' was fashions to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Down by the dyke-side a lady did dwell,
    </p>
    <p>
      At his table head he thought she'd look well,
    </p>
    <p>
      M'Clish's ae daughter o' Clavers-ha' Lee,
    </p>
    <p>
      A penniless lass wi' a lang pedigree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His wig was weel pouther'd and as gude as new,
    </p>
    <p>
      His waistcoat was white, his coat it was blue;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on a ring, a sword, and cock'd hat,
    </p>
    <p>
      And wha could refuse the laird wi' a' that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the grey mare, and rade cannily,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' rapp'd at the yett o' Clavers-ha' Lee;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gae tell Mistress Jean to come speedily ben,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She's wanted to speak to the laird o' Cockpen."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Jean was makin' the elder-flower wine;
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what brings the laird at sic a like time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put aff her apron, and on her silk gown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mutch wi' red ribbons, and gaed awa' down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      An' when she cam' ben he bow'd fu' low,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' what was his errand he soon let her know;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed was the laird when the lady said "Na,"
    </p>
    <p>
      And wi' a laigh curtsie she turned awa'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumfounder'd was he, nae sigh did he gie,
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted his mare&mdash;he rade cannily;
    </p>
    <p>
      An' aften he thought, as he gaed through the glen,
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's daft to refuse the laird o' Cockpen."
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&mdash;Carolina, Lady Nairne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Stanzas added by Miss Ferrier)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that the laird his exit had made,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Jean she reflected on what she had said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, for ane I'll get better, its waur I'll get ten,
    </p>
    <p>
      I was daft to refuse the laird o' Cockpen."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time that the laird and the lady were seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      They were gaun arm-in-arm to the kirk on the green;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she sits in the ha like a weel-tappit hen,
    </p>
    <p>
      But as yet there's nae chickens appear'd at Cockpen.

      Was lovely as a Grecian maid

    <p>
      Young Adam Bruce beside her lay,

      With love and gentle speeches,

      Beneath the budding beeches.

      <br />
    </p>

      From many knights and many squires

      And Gordon, fairest of them all,
    </p>
    <p>
      By Ellen was rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad tidings to that noble youth!

    <p>
      For it may be proclaimed with truth,
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bruce hath loved sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      That Gordon loves as dearly.

    <p>
      His shattered hopes and crosses,
    </p>
    <p>
      To them 'mid Kirtle's pleasant braes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Reclined on flowers and mosses?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas that ever he was born!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gordon, couched behind a thorn,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sees them and their caressing;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beholds them blest and blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Proud Gordon, maddened by the thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
      That through his brain are travelling,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rushed forth, and at the heart of Bruce
    </p>
    <p>
      He launched a deadly javelin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair Ellen saw it as it came,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, stepping forth to meet the same,
    </p>
    <p>
      Did with her body cover
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth, her chosen lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And, falling into Bruce's arms,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus died the beauteous Ellen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, from the heart of her true-love,
    </p>
    <p>
      The mortal spear repelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bruce, as soon as he had slain
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gordon, sailed away to Spain;
    </p>
    <p>
      And fought with rage incessant
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the Moorish crescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But many days, and many months,
    </p>
    <p>
      And many years ensuing,
    </p>
    <p>
      This wretched knight did vainly seek
    </p>
    <p>
      The death that he was wooing:
    </p>
    <p>
      So coming his last help to crave,
    </p>
    <p>
      Heart-broken, upon Ellen's grave
    </p>
    <p>
      His body he extended,
    </p>
    <p>
      And there his sorrow ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now ye, who willingly have heard
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale I have been telling,

    <p>
      May in Kirkconnel churchyard view

      THE SEVEN SISTERS; OR, THE SOLITUDE OF BINNORIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>even daughters had
      Lord Archibald
    </p>
    <p>
      All children of one mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not say in one short day
    </p>
    <p>
      What love they bore each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A garland of seven lilies wrought!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven sisters that together dwell;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, bold knight as ever fought,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their father, took of them no thought,
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved the wars so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh blows the wind, a western wind,
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the shores of Erin,
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the wave, a rover brave
    </p>
    <p>
      To Binnorie is steering:
    </p>
    <p>
      Right onward to the Scottish strand
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallant ship is borne;
    </p>
    <p>
      The warriors leap upon the land,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hark! the leader of the band
    </p>
    <p>
      Hath blown his bugle horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside a grotto of their own,
    </p>
    <p>
      With boughs above them closing,
    </p>
    <p>
      The seven are laid, and in the shade
    </p>
    <p>
      They lie like fawns reposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, upstarting with affright
    </p>
    <p>
      At noise of man and steed,
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they fly to left, to right&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of your fair household, father knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Methinks you take small heed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away the seven fair Campbells fly,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, over hill and hollow,
    </p>
    <p>
      With menace proud, and insult loud,
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful rovers follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cried they, "Your father loves to roam:
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough for him to find
    </p>
    <p>
      The empty house when he comes home;
    </p>
    <p>
      For us your yellow ringlets comb,
    </p>
    <p>
      For us be fair and kind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Some close behind, some side by side,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like clouds in stormy weather,
    </p>
    <p>
      They run, and cry, "Nay, let us die,
    </p>
    <p>
      And let us die together."
    </p>
    <p>
      A lake was near; the shore was steep;
    </p>
    <p>
      There never foot had been;
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran, and with a desperate leap
    </p>
    <p>
      Together plunged into the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor ever more were seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream that flows out of the lake,
    </p>
    <p>
      As through the glen it rambles,
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeats a moan o'er moss and stone,
    </p>
    <p>
      For those seven lovely Campbells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven little islands, green and bare,
    </p>
    <p>
      Have risen from out the deep:
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishers say, those sisters fair
    </p>
    <p>
      By fairies are all buried there,
    </p>
    <p>
      And there together sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitude of Binnorie!

      THE FORCE OF PRAYER or, THE FOUNDING OF BOLTON'S PRIORY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A Tradition.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat is good for a
      bootless bene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With these dark words begins my tale;
    </p>
    <p>
      And their meaning is, Whence can comfort spring
    </p>
    <p>
      When prayer is of no avail?
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is good for a bootless bene?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The falconer to the lady said;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she made answer, "Endless sorrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For she knew that her son was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew it by the falconer's words,
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the look of the falconer's eye;
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the love which was in her soul
    </p>
    <p>
      For her youthful Romilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Romilly through Barden woods
    </p>
    <p>
      Is ranging high and low;
    </p>
    <p>
      And holds a greyhound in a leash,
    </p>
    <p>
      To let slip upon buck or doe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair have reached that fearful chasm,
    </p>
    <p>
      How tempting to bestride!
    </p>
    <p>
      For lordly Wharf is there pent in,
    </p>
    <p>
      With rocks on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This striding-place is called The Strid,
    </p>
    <p>
      A name which it took of yore:
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand years hath it borne that name,
    </p>
    <p>
      And shall a thousand more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And hither is young Romilly come,
    </p>
    <p>
      And what may now forbid
    </p>
    <p>
      That he, perhaps for the hundredth time,
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall bound across The Strid?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang in glee,&mdash;for what cared he
    </p>
    <p>
      That the river was strong, and the rocks were steep?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the greyhound in the leash hung back,
    </p>
    <p>
      And checked him in his leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy is in the arms of Wharf,
    </p>
    <p>
      And strangled by a merciless force;
    </p>
    <p>
      For never more was young Romilly seen
    </p>
    <p>
      Till he rose a lifeless corse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there is stillness in the vale,
    </p>
    <p>
      And long, unspeaking sorrow:
    </p>
    <p>
      Wharf shall be to pitying hearts
    </p>
    <p>
      A name more sad than Yarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If for a lover the lady wept,
    </p>
    <p>
      A solace she might borrow
    </p>
    <p>
      From death, and from the passion of death;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Wharf might heal her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She weeps not for the wedding-day
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was to be to-morrow:
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hope was a farther-looking hope,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hers is a mothers sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tree that stood alone,
    </p>
    <p>
      And proudly did its branches wave;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the root of this delightful tree
    </p>
    <p>
      Was in her husband's grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Long, long in darkness did she sit,
    </p>
    <p>
      And her first words were, "Let there be
    </p>
    <p>
      In Bolton, on the field of Wharf,
    </p>
    <p>
      A stately priory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The stately priory was reared;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Wharf, as he moved along,
    </p>
    <p>
      To matins joined a mournful voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor failed at even-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lady prayed in heaviness
    </p>
    <p>
      That looked not for relief!
    </p>
    <p>
      But slowly did her succour come,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a patience to her grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! there is never sorrow of heart
    </p>
    <p>
      That shall lack a timely end,
    </p>
    <p>
      If but to God we turn, and ask
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Him to be our Friend!
    </p>
    <p>

    <p class="indent5">
      Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall;

    <p>
      Her brother gave but a flask of wine,

    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,

      Lady Herons Song.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>, young Lochinvar
      is come out of the west,
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
    </p>
    <p>
      And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none,
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staid not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone,
    </p>
    <p>
      He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
    </p>
    <p>
      But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
    </p>
    <p>
      For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So boldly he enter'd the Netherby Hall,
    </p>
    <p>
      Among bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
    </p>
    <p>
      (For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)
    </p>
    <p>
      "O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lochinvar s'
    </p>
    <h3>
      63
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now am I come, with this lost love of mine
    </p>
    <p>
      To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
    </p>
    <p>
      That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride kiss'd the goblet: the knight took it up,
    </p>
    <p>
      He quaff'd off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
    </p>
    <p>
      That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
    </p>
    <p>
      While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet
    </p>
    <p>
      and plume;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bride-maidens whisper'd, "'Twere better by far,
    </p>
    <p>
      To have match'd our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
    </p>
    <p>
      One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reach'd the hall-door, and the charger stood near;
    </p>
    <p>
      So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
    </p>
    <p>
      So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;
    </p>
    <p>
      They'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was mounting 'mong GrÃ¦mes of the Netherby clan;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      There was racing and chasing, on Cannobie Lee,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lost bride of Netherby ne er did they see.
    </p>
    <p>
      So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?

      The night is chilly, but not dark.

      The sighs she heaved were soft and low,

      What sees she there?

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There she sees a damsel bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      Drest in a silken robe of white,
    </p>
    <p>
      That shadowy in the moonlight shone:
    </p>
    <p>
      The neck that made that white robe wan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Her stately neck, and arms were bare;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her blue-vein'd feet unsandal'd were;
    </p>
    <p>
      And wildly glitter'd here and there
    </p>
    <p>
      The gems entangled in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess,'twas frightful there to see

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady strange made answer meet,
    </p>
    <p>
      And her voice was faint and sweet:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have pity on my sore distress,

      I scarce can speak for weariness:

    </p>
    <p>
      And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      Did thus pursue her answer meet:&mdash;

    <p>
      And they rode furiously behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They spurred amain, their steeds were white;
    </p>
    <p>
      And once we cross'd the shade of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no thought what men they be;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do I know how long it is
    </p>
    <p>
      (For I have lain entranced I wis)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since one, the tallest of the five,
    </p>
    <p>
      Took me from the palfrey's back,
    </p>
    <p>
      A weary woman, scarce alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mutter'd words his comrades spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed me underneath this oak;
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore they would return with haste;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither they went I cannot tell&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I heard, some minutes past,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds as of a castle bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretch forth thy hand" (thus ended she,)
    </p>
    <p>
      "And help a wretched maid to flee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Christabel stretch'd forth her hand
    </p>
    <p>
      And comforted fair Geraldine:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O well, bright dame! may you command
    </p>
    <p>
      The service of Sir Leoline;
    </p>
    <p>
      And gladly our stout chivalry
    </p>
    <p>
      Will he send forth and friends withal
    </p>
    <p>
      To guide and guard you safe and free
    </p>
    <p>
      Home to your noble father's hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose: and forth with steps they pass'd
    </p>
    <p>
      That strove to be, and were not, fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gracious stars the lady blest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus spake on sweet Christabel:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All our household are at rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall is silent as the cell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Leoline is weak in health
    </p>
    <p>
      And may not well awaken'd be,
    </p>
    <p>
      But we will move as if in stealth;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I beseech your courtesy
    </p>
    <p>
      This night, to share your couch with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the moat, and Christabel
    </p>
    <p>
      Took the key that fitted well;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little door she open'd straight,
    </p>
    <p>
      All in the middle of the gate:
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate that was iron'd within and without,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where an army in battle-array had march'd out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady sank, belike through pain,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christabel with might and main
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifted her up, a weary weight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the threshold of the gate:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lady rose again,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And moved, as she were not in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So, free from danger, free from fear,
    </p>
    <p>
      They cross'd the court; right glad they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christabel devoutly cried
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Lady by her side,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Praise we the Virgin all divine
    </p>
    <p>
      Who hath rescued: thee from thy distress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, alas!" said Geraldine,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot speak for weariness."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, free from danger, free from fear,
    </p>
    <p>
      They cross'd the court: right glad they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside her kennel, the mastiff old
    </p>
    <p>
      Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mastiff old did not awake,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she an angry moan did make!
    </p>
    <p>
      And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
    </p>
    <p>
      Never till now she uttered yell
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the eye of Christabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
    </p>
    <p>
      For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They pass'd the hall, that echoes still,
    </p>
    <p>
      Pass as lightly as you will!
    </p>
    <p>
      The brands were flat, the brands were dying,
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid their own white ashes lying;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the lady pass'd, there came
    </p>
    <p>
      A tongue of light, a fit of flame;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christabel saw the lady's eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      And nothing else saw she thereby,
    </p>
    <p>
      Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
      "O softly tread," said Christabel,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father seldom sleepeth well."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, jealous of the listening air,
    </p>
    <p>
      They steal their way from stair to stair,
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they pass the Baron's room,
    </p>
    <p>
      As still as death, with stifled breath!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now have reach'd her chamber door;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now doth Geraldine press down
    </p>
    <p>
      The rushes of the chamber floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon shines dim in the open air,
    </p>
    <p>
      And not a moonbeam enters here.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they without its light can see
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamber carved so curiously,
    </p>
    <p>
      Carved with figures strange and sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      All made out of the carver's brain,
    </p>
    <p>
      For a lady's chamber meet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp with twofold silver chain
    </p>
    <p>
      Is fasten'd to an angel's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christabel the lamp will trim.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trimm'd the lamp, and made it bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      And left it swinging to and fro,
    </p>
    <p>
      While Geraldine, in wretched plight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sank down upon the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O weary lady, Geraldine,
    </p>
    <p>
      I pray you, drink this cordial wine!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a wine of virtuous powers;
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother made it of wild flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will your mother pity me,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who am a maiden most forlorn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christabel answer'd&mdash;"Woe is me!
    </p>
    <p>
      She died the hour that I was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard the grey-hair'd friar tell,
    </p>
    <p>
      How on her death-bed she did say,
    </p>
    <p>
      That she should hear the castle-bell
    </p>
    <p>
      Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      0 mother dear! that thou wert here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," said Geraldine, "she were!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon with alter'd voice, said she&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!
    </p>
    <p>
      1 have power to bid thee flee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why stares she with unsettled eye?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can she the bodiless dead espy?
    </p>
    <p>
      And why with hollow voice cries she,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off, woman, off! this hour is mine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though thou her guardian spirit be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,
    </p>
    <p>
      And raised to heaven her eyes so blue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said she, "this ghastly ride&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear lady! it hath wilder'd you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady wiped her moist cold brow,
    </p>
    <p>
      And faintly said, "'Tis over now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the wild-flower wine she drank:
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fair large eyes gan glitter bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the floor whereon she sank,
    </p>
    <p>
      The lofty lady stood upright:
    </p>
    <p>
      She was most beautiful to see,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a lady of a far countrÃ©e.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus the lofty lady spake&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "All they, who live in the upper sky,
    </p>
    <p>
      Do love you, holy Christabel!
    </p>
    <p>
      And you love them, and for their sake
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the good which me befell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Even I, in my degree will try,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair maiden, to requite you well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now unrobe yourself; for I
    </p>
    <p>
      Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Quoth Christabel, "So let it be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the lady bade, did she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gentle limbs did she undress,
    </p>
    <p>
      And lay down in her loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But through her brain of weal and woe
    </p>
    <p>
      So many thoughts moved to and fro,
    </p>
    <p>
      That vain it were her lids to close;
    </p>
    <p>
      So half-way from the bed she rose,
    </p>
    <p>
      And on her elbow did recline
    </p>
    <p>
      To look at the lady Geraldine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the lamp the lady bow'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      And slowly rolled her eyes around;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then drawing in her breath aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one that shudder'd, she unbound
    </p>
    <p>
      The cincture from beneath her breast:
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silken robe, and inner vest,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropt to her feet, and full in view,
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold! her bosom and half her side&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sight to dream of, not to tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep from within she seems half-way
    </p>
    <p>
      To lift some weight with sick assay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, as one defied,
    </p>
    <p>
      Collects herself in scorn and pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      And lay down by the maiden's side! &mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in her arms the maid she took,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah well-a-day!
    </p>
    <p>
      And with low voice and doleful look
    </p>
    <p>
      These words did say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,
    </p>
    <p>
      This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But vainly thou warrest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For this is alone in
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Thy power to declare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That in the dim forest
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Thou heard'st a low moaning,
    </p>
    <p>
      And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair:
    </p>
    <p>
      And didst bring her home with thee, in love and in charity,
    </p>
    <p>
      To shield her and shelter her from the damp air."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE CONCLUSION TO PART I.

    <p>
      It was a lovely sight to see
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Christabel, when she
    </p>
    <p>
      Was praying at the old oak tree.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Amid the jagged shadows
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Of mossy leafless boughs
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Kneeling in the moonlight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      To make her gentle vows;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her slender palms together prest,
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaving sometimes on her breast;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face resign'd to bliss or bale&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face, oh call it fair not pale,
    </p>
    <p>
      And both blue eyes more bright than clear,
    </p>
    <p>
      Each about to have a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With open eyes (ah woe is me!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreaming that alone, which is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady who knelt at the old oak tree?
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo! the worker of these harms,
    </p>
    <p>
      That holds the maiden in her arms,
    </p>
    <p>
      Seems to slumber still and mild,
    </p>
    <p>
      As a mother with her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A star hath set, a star hath risen,
    </p>
    <p>
      O Geraldine! since arms of thine
    </p>
    <p>
      Have been the lovely lady's prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      O Geraldine! one hour was thine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill,
    </p>
    <p>
      The night-birds all that hour were still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now they are jubilant anew,
    </p>
    <p>
      From cliff and tower, tu&mdash;whoo! tu&mdash;whoo!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tu&mdash;whoo! tu&mdash;whoo! from wood and fell!

      And, see! the lady Christabel
    </p>
    <p>
      Gathers herself from out her trance;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her limbs relax, her countenance
    </p>
    <p>
      Grows sad and soft; 'the smooth thin lids
    </p>
    <p>
      Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Large tears that leave the lashes bright!
    </p>
    <p>
      And oft the while she seems to smile
    </p>
    <p>
      As infants at a sudden light!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a youthful hermitess,
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauteous in a wilderness,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, praying always, prays in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, if she move unquietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Perchance,'tis but the blood so free,
    </p>
    <p>
      Comes back and tingles in her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt, she hath a vision sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if her guardian spirit 'twere?
    </p>
    <p>
      What if she knew her mother near?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this she knows, in joys and woes,
    </p>
    <p>
      That saints will aid if men will call:
    </p>
    <p>
      For the blue sky bends over all!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Each matin bell," the Baron saith,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knells us back to a world of death."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words Sir Leoline first said,
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose and found his lady dead:
    </p>
    <p>
      These words Sir Leoline will say,
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a morn to his dying day!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And hence the custom and law began,
    </p>
    <p>
      That still at dawn the sacristan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who duly pulls the heavy bell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Five and forty beads must tell
    </p>
    <p>
      Between each stroke&mdash;a warning knell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which not a soul can choose but hear
    </p>
    <p>
      From Bratha Head to Windermere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Saith Bracy the bard, "So let it knell!
    </p>
    <p>
      And let the drowsy sacristan
    </p>
    <p>
      Still count as slowly as he can!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no lack of such, I ween,
    </p>
    <p>
      As well fill up the space between."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,
    </p>
    <p>
      With ropes of rock and bells of air
    </p>
    <p>
      Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who all give back, one after t'other,
    </p>
    <p>
      The death-note to their living brother;
    </p>
    <p>
      And oft too, by the knell offended,
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as their one! two! three! is ended,
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil mocks the doleful tale
    </p>
    <p>
      With a merry peal from Borrowdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The air is still! through mist and cloud
    </p>
    <p>
      That merry peal comes ringing loud;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Geraldine shakes off her dread,
    </p>
    <p>
      And rises lightly from the bed;
    </p>
    <p>
      Puts on her silken vestments white,
    </p>
    <p>
      And tricks her hair in lovely plight,
    </p>
    <p>
      And nothing doubting of her spell
    </p>
    <p>
      Awakens the lady Christabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?
    </p>
    <p>
      I trust that you have rested well."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christabel awoke and spied
    </p>
    <p>
      The same who lay down by her side&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh rather say, the same whom she
    </p>
    <p>
      Raised up beneath the old oak tree!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!
    </p>
    <p>
      For she belike hath drunken deep
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the blessedness of sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      And while she spake, her looks, her air,
    </p>
    <p>
      Such gentle thankfulness declare,
    </p>
    <p>
      That (so it seem'd) her girded vests
    </p>
    <p>
      Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure I have sinn'd!" said Christabel,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now heaven be praised if all be well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And in low faltering tones, yet sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she the lofty lady greet,
    </p>
    <p>
      With such perplexity of mind
    </p>
    <p>
      As dreams too lively leave behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So quickly she rose, and quickly array'd
    </p>
    <p>
      Her maiden limbs, and having pray'd
    </p>
    <p>
      That He, who on the Cross did groan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Might wash away her sins unknown,
    </p>
    <p>
      She forthwith led fair Geraldine
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet her sire, Sir Leoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely maid and the lady tall
    </p>
    <p>
      Are pacing both into the hall,
    </p>
    <p>
      And pacing on through page and groom
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the Baron's presence-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron rose, and while he prest
    </p>
    <p>
      His gentle daughter to his breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      With cheerful wonder in his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady Geraldine he espies,
    </p>
    <p>
      And gave such welcome to the same,
    </p>
    <p>
      As might beseem so bright a dame!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he heard the lady's tale,
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she told her father's name,
    </p>
    <p>
      Why wax'd Sir Leoline so pale,
    </p>
    <p>
      Murmuring o'er the name again,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! they had been friends in youth;
    </p>
    <p>
      But whispering tongues can poison truth;
    </p>
    <p>
      And constancy lives in realms above;
    </p>
    <p>
      And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
    </p>
    <p>
      And to be wroth with one we love,
    </p>
    <p>
      Doth work like madness in the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it chanced, as I divine,
    </p>
    <p>
      With Roland and Sir Leoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each spake words of high disdain
    </p>
    <p>
      And insult to his heart's best brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted&mdash;ne'er to meet again!
    </p>
    <p>
      But never either found another
    </p>
    <p>
      To free the hollow heart from paining&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreary sea now flows between.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall wholly do away, I ween,
    </p>
    <p>
      The marks of that which once hath been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Leoline, a moment's space,
    </p>
    <p>
      Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
    </p>
    <p>
      And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
    </p>
    <p>
      Came back upon his heart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh then the Baron forgot his age,
    </p>
    <p>
      His noble heart swelled high with rage;
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side,
    </p>
    <p>
      He would proclaim it far and wide
    </p>
    <p>
      With trump and solemn heraldry,
    </p>
    <p>
      That they who thus had wrong'd the dame
    </p>
    <p>
      Were base as spotted infamy! -.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if they dare deny the same,
    </p>
    <p>
      My herald shall appoint a week,
    </p>
    <p>
      And let the recreant traitors seek
    </p>
    <p>
      My tourney court&mdash;that there and then
    </p>
    <p>
      I may dislodge their reptile souls
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bodies and forms of men!''
    </p>
    <p>
      He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beautiful lady the child of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the tears were on his face,
    </p>
    <p>
      And fondly in his arms he took
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,
    </p>
    <p>
      Prolonging it with joyous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which when she viewed, a vision fell
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the soul of Christabel,
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision of fear, the touch and pain!
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrunk and shudder'd, and saw again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Ah! woe is me! Was it for thee,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she saw that bosom old,
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she felt that bosom cold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereat the Knight turn'd wildly round,
    </p>
    <p>
      And nothing saw but his own sweet maid,
    </p>
    <p>
      With eyes upraised, as one that pray'd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch, the sight, had pass'd away,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in its stead that vision blest,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which comforted her after-rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      While in the lady's arms she lay,
    </p>
    <p>
      Had put a rapture in her breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And on her lips and o'er her eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      Spread smiles like light!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With new surprise,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails then my beloved child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron said&mdash;His daughter mild
    </p>
    <p>
      Made answer, "All will yet be well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I ween she had no power to tell
    </p>
    <p>
      Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,
    </p>
    <p>
      Had deemed her sure a thing divine,
    </p>
    <p>
      Such sorrow with such grace she blended,
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she feared she had offended
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!
    </p>
    <p>
      And with such lowly tones she pray'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      She might be sent without delay
    </p>
    <p>
      Home to her father's mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Nay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, by my soul!" said Leoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Go thou, with music sweet and loud,
    </p>
    <p>
      And take two steeds with trappings proud,
    </p>
    <p>
      And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
    </p>
    <p>
      To bear thy harp and learn thy song,
    </p>
    <p>
      And clothe you both in solemn vest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And over the mountains haste along,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest wandering folk that are abroad
    </p>
    <p>
      Detain you on the valley road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he has cross'd the Irthing flood,
    </p>
    <p>
      My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes
    </p>
    <p>
      Up Knorren moor, through Halegarth Wood,
    </p>
    <p>
      And reaches soon that castle good
    </p>
    <p>
      Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,
    </p>
    <p>
      More loud than your horses' echoing feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      And loud and loud to Lord Roland call
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thy daughter is safe in Langdale Hall!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bids thee come without delay
    </p>
    <p>
      With all thy numerous array,
    </p>
    <p>
      And take thy lovely daughter home:
    </p>
    <p>
      And he will meet thee on the way
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his numerous array
    </p>
    <p>
      White with their panting palfreys' foam:
    </p>
    <p>
      And, by mine honour! I will say
    </p>
    <p>
      That I repent me of the day
    </p>
    <p>
      When I spake words of fierce disdain
    </p>
    <p>
      To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!
    </p>
    <p>
      For since that evil hour hath flown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a summer sun hath shone;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet ne'er found I a friend again
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady fell, and clasp'd his knees,
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bracy replied with faltering voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      His gracious hail on all bestowing;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,
    </p>
    <p>
      Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet might I gain a boon of thee,
    </p>
    <p>
      This day my journey should not be;
    </p>
    <p>
      So strange a dream hath come to me;
    </p>
    <p>
      That I had vow'd with music loud
    </p>
    <p>
      To clear yon wood from thing unblest,
    </p>
    <p>
      Warn'd by a vision in my rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      For in my sleep I saw that dove,
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,
    </p>
    <p>
      And call'st by thy own daughter's name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Leoline! I saw the same,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which when I saw and when I heard,
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder'd what might ail the bird;
    </p>
    <p>
      For nothing near it could I see,
    </p>
    <p>
      Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in my dream methought I went
    </p>
    <p>
      To search out what might there be found;
    </p>
    <p>
      And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,
    </p>
    <p>
      That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went and peer'd, and could descry
    </p>
    <p>
      No cause for her distressful cry;
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet for her dear lady's sake
    </p>
    <p>
      I stoop'd, methought, the dove to take,
    </p>
    <p>
      When lo! I saw a bright green snake
    </p>
    <p>
      Coil'd around its wings and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green as the herbs on which it couch'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by the dove's its head it crouch'd;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the dove it heaves and stirs,
    </p>
    <p>
      Swelling its neck as she swell'd hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke; it was the midnight hour,
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock was echoing in the tower;
    </p>
    <p>
      But though my slumber was gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dream it would not pass away&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to live upon my eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      And thence I vow'd this self-same day,
    </p>
    <p>
      With music strong and saintly song,
    </p>
    <p>
      To wander through the forest bare,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest aught unholy loiter there."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-listening, heard him with a smile;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turned to Lady Geraldine,
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes made up of wonder and love;
    </p>
    <p>
      And said in courtly accents fine,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteotis dove,
    </p>
    <p>
      With arms more strong than harp or song,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy sire and I will crush the snake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He kiss'd her forehead as he spake,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Geraldine, in maiden wise,
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting down her large bright eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      With blushing cheek and courtesy fine,
    </p>
    <p>
      She turn'd her from Sir Leoline;
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly gathering up her train,
    </p>
    <p>
      That o'er her right arm fell again;
    </p>
    <p>
      And folded her arms across her chest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And crouched her head upon her breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And look'd askance at Christabel-
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesu, Maria, shield her well!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,
    </p>
    <p>
      Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      And with somewhat of malice, and more
    </p>
    <p>
      of dread
    </p>
    <p>
      At Christabel she look'd askance!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment&mdash;and the sight was fled!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christabel in dizzy trance
    </p>
    <p>
      Stumbling on the unsteady ground
    </p>
    <p>
      Shudder'd aloud, with a hissing sound;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Geraldine again turn'd round,
    </p>
    <p>
      And like a thing, that sought relief,
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of wonder and full of grief,
    </p>
    <p>
      She roll'd her large bright eyes divine
    </p>
    <p>
      Wildly on Sir Leoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,
    </p>
    <p>
      She nothing sees&mdash;no sight but one!
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid, devoid of guile and sin,
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not how, in fearful wise
    </p>
    <p>
      So deeply had she drunken in
    </p>
    <p>
      That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      That all her features were resign'd
    </p>
    <p>
      To this sole image in her mind:
    </p>
    <p>
      And passively did imitate
    </p>
    <p>
      That look of dull and treacherous hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,
    </p>
    <p>
      Still picturing that look askance,
    </p>
    <p>
      With forced unconscious sympathy,
    </p>
    <p>
      Full before her father's view-
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as such a look could be,
    </p>
    <p>
      In eyes so innocent and blue!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the trance was o'er, the maid
    </p>
    <p>
      Paused awhile, and inly pray'd:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then falling at the Baron's feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my mothers soul do I entreat
    </p>
    <p>
      That thou this woman send away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: and more she could not say:
    </p>
    <p>
      For what she knew she could not tell,
    </p>
    <p>
      O er-master'd by the mighty spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Leoline? Thy only child
    </p>
    <p>
      Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      So fair, so innocent, so mild;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same, for whom thy lady died!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh by the pangs of her dear mother
    </p>
    <p>
      Think thou no evil of thy child!
    </p>
    <p>
      For her, and thee, and for no other,
    </p>
    <p>
      She pray'd the moment ere she died,
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray'd that the babe for whom she died,
    </p>
    <p>
      Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sir Leoline!
    </p>
    <p>
      And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Her child and thine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the Baron's heart and brain
    </p>
    <p>
      If thoughts like these had any share,
    </p>
    <p>
      They only swell'd his rage and pain,
    </p>
    <p>
      And did but work confusion there.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was cleft with pain and rage,
    </p>
    <p>
      His cheeks they quiver'd, his eyes were wild,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dishonour'd thus in his old age,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dishonour'd by his only child,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all his hospitality
    </p>
    <p>
      To the wrong'd daughter of his friend
    </p>
    <p>
      By more than woman's jealousy
    </p>
    <p>
      Brought thus to a disgraceful end&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He roll'd his eye with stern regard
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the gentle minstrel bard,
    </p>
    <p>
      And said in tones abrupt, austere&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?
    </p>
    <p>
      I bade thee hence!" The bard obey'd;
    </p>
    <p>
      And turning from his own sweet maid,
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged knight, Sir Leoline,
    </p>
    <p>
      Led forth the Lady Geraldine!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>
      THE CONCLUSION TO II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A little child, a limber elf,
    </p>
    <p>
      Singing, dancing to itself,
    </p>
    <p>
      A fairy thing with red round cheeks
    </p>
    <p>
      That always finds, and never seeks,
    </p>
    <p>
      Makes such a vision to the sight
    </p>
    <p>
      As fills a fathers eyes with light;
    </p>
    <p>
      And pleasures flow in so thick and fast
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his heart, that he at last
    </p>
    <p>
      Must needs express his love's excess
    </p>
    <p>
      With words of unmeant bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts so all unlike each other;
    </p>
    <p>
      To mutter and mock a broken charm,
    </p>
    <p>
      To dally with wrong that does no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty
    </p>
    <p>
      At each wild word to feel within
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweet recoil of love and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what, if in a world of sin
    </p>
    <p>
      (Oh sorrow and shame should this be true!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Such giddiness of heart and brain
    </p>
    <p>
      Comes seldom save from rage and pain,
    </p>
    <p>
      So talks as it's most used to do.

      THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is an ancient
      Mariner,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he stoppeth one of three.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I am next of kin;
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests are met, the feast is set:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      May'st hear the merry din."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He holds him with his skinny hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a ship," quoth he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He holds him with his glittering eye&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-guest stood still,
    </p>
    <p>
      And listens like a three-years' child:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mariner hath his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-guest sat on a stone;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cannot choose but hear;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus spake on that ancient man,
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright-eyed Mariner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ship was cheer'd, the harbour clear'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      Merrily did we drop
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the kirk, below the hill,
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the lighthouse top.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun came up upon the left,
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the sea came he!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he shone bright, and on the right
    </p>
    <p>
      Went down into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Higher and higher every day,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till over the mast at noon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-guest here beat his breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he heard the loud bassoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride hath paced into the hall,
    </p>
    <p>
      Red as a rose is she;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodding their heads before her goes
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry minstrelsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-guest he beat his breast,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he cannot choose but hear;
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus spake on that ancient man,
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright-eyed Mariner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now the storm-blast came, and he
    </p>
    <p>
      Was tyrannous and strong:
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
    </p>
    <p>
      And chased us south along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "With sloping masts and dipping prow,
    </p>
    <p>
      As who pursued with yell and blow
    </p>
    <p>
      Still treads the shadow of his foe
    </p>
    <p>
      And forward bends his head,
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship drove fast, loud roar'd the blast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And southward aye we fled.

      The boat came close beneath the ship,

      It reach'd the ship, it split the bay;

      The ship went down like lead.

    </p>
    <p>
      "Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,

    <p>
      "Upon the whirl, where sank the ship

      The boat spun round and round;

    <p>
      And all was still, save that the hill

      Was telling of the sound.

      The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      And pray'd where he did sit.

    </p>
    <p>
      "I took the oars: the pilot's boy,

    <p>
      Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while

    <p>
      His eyes went to and fro.

    <p>
      'Ha! ha!' quoth he, 'full plain I see,

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, all in my own countree,
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood on the firm land!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,
    </p>
    <p>
      And scarcely he could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "'O, shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man! '
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hermit cross'd his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ' Say quick,' quoth he, 'I bid thee say&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd

    <p>
      With a woeful agony,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which forced me to begin my tale;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it left me free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since then at an uncertain hour,

    <p>
      And till my ghastly tale is told,

    </p>
    <p>
      The tables they groan'd with the weight of the feast,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceased,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When the bell of the castle toll'd&mdash;"one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then first with amazement fair Imogine found
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That a stranger was placed by her side:
    </p>
    <p>
      His air was terrific; he uttered no sound;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke not, he moved not, he look'd not around,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But earnestly gazed on the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His vizor was closed, and gigantic his height,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His armour was sable to view:
    </p>
    <p>
      All pleasure and laughter were hush'd at his sight,
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs, as they eyed him, drew back in affright,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The lights in the chamber burnt blue!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence all bosoms appear'd to dismay;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The guests sat in silence and fear:
    </p>
    <p>
      At length spoke the bride, while she trembled:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray, Sir knight, that your helmet aside you would lay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And deign to partake of our cheer."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady is silent; the stranger complies;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His vizor he slowly unclosed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! then what a sight met Fair Imogine's eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      What words can express her dismay and surprise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When a skeleton's head was exposed!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All present then utter'd a terrified shout;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All turn'd with disgust from the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worms they crept in, and the worms they crept out,
    </p>
    <p>
      And sported his eyes and his temples about,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While the spectre address'd Imogine:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold me, thou false one! behold me!" he cried;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Remember Alonzo the Brave!
    </p>
    <p>
      God grants that, to punish thy falsehood and pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      My ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side,
    </p>
    <p>
      Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And bear thee away to the grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, his arms round the lady he wound,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While loudly she shriek'd in dismay,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sank with his prey through the wide-yawning ground:
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor ever again was Fair Imogine found,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or the spectre who bore her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long lived the Baron: and none since that time
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To inhabit the castle presume;
    </p>
    <p>
      For chronicles tell, that, by order sublime,
    </p>
    <p>
      There Imogine suffers the pain of her crime,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And mourns her deplorable doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight four times in each year does her sprite,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When mortals in slumber are bound,
    </p>
    <p>
      Array'd in her bridal apparel of white,

      Appear in the hall with the skeleton-knight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And shriek as he whirls her around.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      While they drink out of skulls newly torn from
    </p>
    <p>
      the grave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Dancing round them pale spectres are seen:

    <p>
      Their liquor is blood, and this horrible stave
    </p>
    <p>
      They howl:&mdash;"To the health of Alonzo the

      We met them, and o'erthrew them:
    </p>
    <p>
      They struggled hard to beat us;
    </p>
    <p>
      But we conquered them, and slew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove our prize at leisure,
    </p>
    <p>
      The king marched forth to catch us:
    </p>
    <p>
      His rage surpassed all measure,
    </p>
    <p>
      But his people could not match us.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fled to his hall-pillars;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, ere our force we led off,
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sacked his house and cellars,
    </p>
    <p>
      While others cut his head off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We there, in strife bewildering,
    </p>
    <p>
      Spilt blood enough to swim in:
    </p>
    <p>
      We orphaned many children,
    </p>
    <p>
      And widowed many women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eagles and the ravens
    </p>
    <p>
      We glutted with our foemen;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heroes and the cravens,
    </p>
    <p>
      The spearmen and the bowmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We brought away from battle,
    </p>
    <p>
      And much their land bemoaned them,
    </p>
    <p>
      Two thousand head of cattle,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the head of him who owned them:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ednyfed, King of Dyfed,
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was borne before us;
    </p>
    <p>
      His wine and beasts supplied our feasts,
    </p>
    <p>
      And his overthrow, our chorus.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sage Ceridwen
      was the wife
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Tegid VoÃ«l, of Pemble Mere:
    </p>
    <p>
      Two children blest their wedded life,
    </p>
    <p>
      Morvran and Creirwy, fair and dear:
    </p>
    <p>
      Morvran, a son of peerless worth,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Creirwy, loveliest nymph of earth:
    </p>
    <p>
      But one more son Ceridwen bare,
    </p>
    <p>
      As foul as they before were fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She strove to make Avagddu wise;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew he never could be fair:
    </p>
    <p>
      And, studying magic mysteries,
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered plants of virtue rare:
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed the gifted plants to steep
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the magic cauldron deep,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where they a year and day must boil,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till three drops crown the matron's toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine damsels raised the mystic flame;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwion the Little near it stood:
    </p>
    <p>
      The while for simples roved the dame
    </p>
    <p>
      Through tangled dell and pathless wood;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when the year and day had past,
    </p>
    <p>
      The dame within the cauldron cast
    </p>
    <p>
      The consummating chaplet wild,
    </p>
    <p>
      While Gwion held the hideous child.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the cauldron rose a smoke
    </p>
    <p>
      That filled with darkness all the air:
    </p>
    <p>
      When through its folds the torchlight broke,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor Gwion, nor the boy, was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was dead, the cauldron cold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in it lay, in sleep unrolled,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair as the morning-star, a child,
    </p>
    <p>
      That woke, and stretched its arms, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What chanced her labours to destroy,
    </p>
    <p>
      She never knew; and sought in vain
    </p>
    <p>
      If Were her own misshapen boy,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or little Gwion, born again:
    </p>
    <p>
      And, vext with doubt, the babe she rolled
    </p>
    <p>
      In cloth of purple and of gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a coracle consigned
    </p>
    <p>
      Its fortunes to the sea and wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer night was still and bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer moon was large and clear,
    </p>
    <p>
      The frail bark, on the springtide's height,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was floated into Elphin's weir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby in his arms he raised:
    </p>
    <p>
      His lovely spouse stood by, and gazed,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, blessing it with gentle vow,
    </p>
    <p>
      Cried "Taliesin!" "Radiant brow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And I am he: and well I know
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceridwen's power protects me still;
    </p>
    <p>
      -And hence o er hill and vale I go,
    </p>
    <p>
      And sing, unharmed, whate'er I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has for me Time's veil withdrawn:
    </p>
    <p>
      The images of things long gone,
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows of the coming days,
    </p>
    <p>
      Are present to my visioned gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have heard the words of power,
    </p>
    <p>
      By Ceirion's solitary lake,
    </p>
    <p>
      That bid, at midnight's thrilling hour,
    </p>
    <p>
      Eryri's hundred echoes wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I to Diganwy's towers have sped,
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Caer Lleon's halls I tread,
    </p>
    <p>
      Demanding justice, now, as then,
    </p>
    <p>
      From Maelgon, most unjust of men.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>wenwynwyn withdrew
      from the feasts of his hall;
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept very little, he prayed not at all;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered, and wandered, and studied alone;
    </p>
    <p>
      And sought, night and day, the philosopher's stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it at length, and he made its first proof
    </p>
    <p>
      By turning to gold all the lead of his roof:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bought some magnanimous heroes, all fire,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who lived but to smite and be smitten for hire.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these, on the plains like a torrent he broke;
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled the whole country with flame and with smoke;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He killed all the swine, and he broached all the wine;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove off the sheep, and the beeves, and the kine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He took castles and towns; he cut short limbs and lives;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made orphans and widows of children and wives:
    </p>
    <p>
      This course many years he triumphantly ran,
    </p>
    <p>
      And did mischief enough to be called a great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at last, he had gained all for which he had striven,
    </p>
    <p>
      He bethought him of buying a passport to heaven;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good and great as he was, yet he did not well know
    </p>
    <p>
      How soon, or which way, his great spirit might go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought the grey friars, who, beside a wild stream,
    </p>
    <p>
      Refected their frames on a primitive scheme;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gravest and wisest Gwenwynwyn found out,
    </p>
    <p>
      All lonely and ghostly, and angling for trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the white dash of a mighty cascade,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a pool of the stream a deep resting-place made,
    </p>
    <p>
      And rock-rooted oaks stretched their branches on high,
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar stood musing and throwing his fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To him said Gwenwynwyn, "Hold, father, here's store,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the good of the church, and the good of the poor;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave him the stone; but, ere more he could speak,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrath came on the friar, so holy and meek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stretched forth his hand to receive the red gold,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought himself mocked by Gwenwynwyn the Bold;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in scorn of the gift, and in rage at the giver,
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked it immediately into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwenwynwyn, aghast, not a syllable spake;
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher's stone made a duck and a drake;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two systems of circles a moment were seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the, stream smoothed them off, as they never had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwenwynwyn regained, and uplifted, his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh friar, grey friar, full rash was thy choice;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone, the good stone, which away thou hast thrown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the stone of all stones, the philosopher's stone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar looked pale, when his error he knew;
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar looked red, and the friar looked blue;
    </p>
    <p>
      And heels over head, from the point of a rock,
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged, without stopping to pull off his frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He dived very deep, but he dived all in vain,
    </p>
    <p>
      The prize he had slighted he found not again:
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times did the friar his diving renew,
    </p>
    <p>
      And deeper and deeper the river still grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwenwynwyn gazed long, of his senses in doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the grey friar a diver so stout:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sadly and slowly his castle he sought,
    </p>
    <p>
      And left the friar diving, like dabchick distraught.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwenwynwyn fell sick with alarm and despite,
    </p>
    <p>
      Died, and went to the devil, the very same night:
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnanimous heroes he held in his pay
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacked his castle, and marched with the plunder away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No knell on the silence of midnight was rolled,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the flight of the soul of Gwenwynwyn the Bold:
    </p>
    <p>
      The brethren, unfeed, let the mighty ghost pass,
    </p>
    <p>
      Without praying a prayer, or intoning a mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar haunted ever beside the dark stream;
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher's stone was his thought and his dream:
    </p>
    <p>
      And day after day, ever head under heels
    </p>
    <p>
      He dived all the time he could spare from his meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dived, and he dived, to the end of his days,
    </p>
    <p>
      As the peasants oft witnessed with fear and amaze:
    </p>
    <p>
      The mad friar's diving-place long was their theme,
    </p>
    <p>
      And no plummet can fathom that pool of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And still, when light clouds on the midnight winds ride,
    </p>
    <p>
      If by moonlight you stray on the lone river-side,
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost of the friar may be seen diving there,
    </p>
    <p>
      With head in the water, and heels in the air.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A carpenter by trade;

      And he fell in love with Sally Brown,

    <p class="indent5">
      That was a lady's maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they fetched a walk one day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They met a press-gang crew;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sally she did faint away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Whilst Ben he was brought to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boatswain swore with wicked words,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Enough to shock a saint,
    </p>
    <p>
      That though she did seem in a fit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Twas nothing but a feint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      "Come, girl," said he, "hold up your head,

    <p class="indent5">
      He'll be as good as me;

    <p>
      For when your swain is in our boat,

      A boatswain he will be."
    </p>
    <p>

      So when they'd made their game of her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And taken off her elf,
    </p>
    <p>
      She roused, and found she only was

    <p class="indent5">
      A coming to herself.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is he gone, and is he gone?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She cried, and wept outright:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will to the water side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And see him out of sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A waterman came up to her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Now, young woman," said he,
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you weep on so, you will make
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Eye-water in the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! they've taken my beau, Ben,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To sail with old Benbow;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And her woe began to run afresh,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As if she'd said, Gee woe!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Says he, "They've only taken him
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To the Tender-ship, you see;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Tender-ship," cried Sally Brown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "What a hard-ship that must be!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! would I were a mermaid now,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For then I'd follow him;
    </p>
    <p>
      But oh!&mdash;I'm not a fish-woman,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And so I cannot swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! I was not born beneath
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The Virgin and the Scales,

    <p>
      So I must curse my cruel stars,

      And walk about in Wales."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Ben had sailed to many a place
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That's underneath the world;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in two years the ship came home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And all her sails were furled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he called on Sally Brown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To see how she went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      He found she'd got another Ben,

    <p class="indent5">
      Whose Christian name was John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Sally Brown, O Sally Brown,

      But never such a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then reading on his 'bacco box,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He heaved a bitter sigh,

      And then to pipe his eye.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he tried to sing "All's Well,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But could not though he tried:

    <p>
      His head was turned, and so he chewed

    <p>
      "Oh, false and fickle Nelly Gray!

    <p class="indent5">
      I know why you refuse:&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      His heart so heavy got&mdash;

      It made him take a knot!

      He soon was off his legs!

      A dozen men sat on his corpse,

      THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>was in the prime
      of summer time,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      An evening calm and cool,
    </p>
    <p>
      And four-and-twenty happy boys
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Came bounding out of school:
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some that ran and some that leapt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like troutlets in a pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they sped with gamesome minds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And souls untouched by sin;
    </p>
    <p>
      To a level mead they came, and there
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They drave the wickets in:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasantly shone the setting sun
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Over the town of Lynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Like sportive deer they coursed about,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And shouted as they ran,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to mirth all things of earth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As only boyhood can;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Usher sat remote from all,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A melancholy man!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His hat was off, his vest apart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To catch heaven's blessed breeze;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a burning thought was in his brow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And his bosom ill at ease:
    </p>
    <p>
      So he leaned his head on his hands, and read
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The book upon his knees!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaf after leaf he turned it o'er,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor ever glanced aside,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the peace of his soul he read that book
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the golden eventide:
    </p>
    <p>
      Much study had made him very lean,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And pale, and leaden-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he shut the pond'rous tome,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With a fast and fervent grasp
    </p>
    <p>
      He strained the dusky covers close,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And fixed the brazen hasp:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God! could I so close my mind,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And clasp it with a clasp!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then leaping on his feet upright,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Some moody turns he took,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now up the mead, then down the mead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And past a shady nook,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo! he saw a little boy
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That pored upon a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My gentle lad, what is't you read&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Romance or fairy fable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or is it some historic page,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of kings and crown unstable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young boy gave an upward glance,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "It is 'The Death of Abel.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Usher took six hasty strides,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As smit with sudden pain,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Six hasty strides beyond the place,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then slowly back again;
    </p>
    <p>
      And down he sat beside the lad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And talked with him of Cain;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And, long since then, of bloody men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Whose deeds tradition saves;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of lonely folk cut off unseen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And hid in sudden graves;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of horrid stabs, in groves forlorn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And murders done in caves;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And how the sprites of injured men
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shriek upward from the sod,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, how the ghostly hand will point
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To show the burial clod;
    </p>
    <p>
      And unknown facts of guilty acts
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Are seen in dreams from God!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He told how murderers walk the earth
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Beneath the curse of Cain&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With crimson clouds before their eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And flames about their brain:

    <p>
      For blood has left upon their souls
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Its everlasting stain!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And well,'' quoth he, "I know, for truth,

    </p>
    <p>
      Woe, woe, unutterable woe,&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      Who spill life's sacred stream!
    </p>
    <p>
      For why? Methought, last night, I wrought
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A murder, in my dream!

      A feeble man, and old;

    <p>
      I led him to a lonely field,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The moon shone clear and cold:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here, said I, this man shall die,

      And I will have his gold!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two sudden blows with a ragged stick,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And one with a heavy stone,
    </p>
    <p>
      One hurried gash with a hasty knife,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And then the deed was done:
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing lying at my foot
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But lifeless flesh and bone!

      That could not do me ill;

    <p class="indent5">
      For lying there so still:

      There was a manhood in his look,

      In secret I was there:

      THE VOYAGE WITH THE NAUTILUS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> made myself a
      little boat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As trim as trim could be;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made it of a great pearl shell
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Found in the Indian Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my masts of wild sea-rush
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That grew on a secret shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the scarlet plume of the halcyon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was the pleasant flag I bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For my sails I took the butterfly's wings.,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For my ropes the spider's line;
    </p>
    <p>
      And that mariner old, the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To steer me over the brine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For he had sailed six thousand years,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And knew each isle and bay;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I thought that we, in my little boat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Could merrily steer away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The stores I took were plentiful:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The dew as it sweetly fell;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the honey that was hoarded up
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the wild bee's summer cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now steer away, thou helmsman good,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Over the waters free;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the charmed Isle of the Seven Kings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That lies in the midmost sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He spread the sail, he took the helm;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And, long ere ever I wist,
    </p>
    <p>
      We had sailed a league, we had reached the isle
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That lay in the golden mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The charmed Isle of the Seven Kings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      'Tis a place of wondrous spell;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that happed unto me there
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a printed book I'll tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Said I, one day, to the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As we stood on the strand,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unmoor my ship, thou helmsman good,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And steer me back to land;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my mother, I know, is sick at heart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And longs my face to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      What ails thee now, thou Nautilus?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Art slow to sail with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Up! do my will; the wind is fresh,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So set the vessel free."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the helm; away we sailed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Towards the setting sun:
    </p>
    <p>
      The flying-fish were swift of wing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But we outsped each one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And on we went for seven days,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Seven days without a night;
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed the sun still on and on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the glow of his setting light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Down and down went the setting sun,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And down and down went we;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a splendid sail for seven days
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On a smooth descending sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On a smooth, descending sea we sailed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor breeze the water curled:
    </p>
    <p>
      My brain grew sick, for I saw we sailed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On the down-hill of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good friend," said I to the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Can this the right course be?
    </p>
    <p>
      And shall we come again to land?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But answer none made he;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I saw a laugh in his fishy eye
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As he turned it up to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So on we went; but soon I heard
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A sound as when winds blow,
    </p>
    <p>
      And waters wild are tumbled down
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Into a gulf below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And on and on flew the little bark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As a fiend her course did urge;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I saw, in a moment, we must hang
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon the oceans verge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I snatched down the sails, I snapped the ropes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I broke the masts in twain;
    </p>
    <p>
      But on flew the bark and gainst the rocks
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like a living thing did strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou'st steered us wrong, thou helmsman vile!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Said I to the Nautilus bold;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall down the gulf; were dead men both!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Dost know the course we hold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized the helm with a sudden jerk,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And we wheeled round like a bird;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I saw the Gulf of Eternity,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the tideless waves I heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good master," said the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "I thought you might desire
    </p>
    <p>
      To have some wondrous thing to tell
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Beside your mother's fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's sailing on a summer sea?
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As well sail on a pool;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, but I know a thousand things
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That are wild and beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you wish to see them now,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You've but to say the word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have done!" said I to the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Or I'll throw thee overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have done!" said I, "thou mariner old,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And steer me back to land."
    </p>
    <p>
      No other word spake the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But took the helm in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up to the lady moon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She was like a glow-worm's spark;
    </p>
    <p>
      And never a star shone down to us
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Through the sky so high and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no mast, we had no ropes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And every sail was rent;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the stores I brought from the charmed isle
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the seven days' sail were spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Nautilus was a patient thing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And steered with all his might
    </p>
    <p>
      On the up-hill sea; and he never slept,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But kept the course aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And for thrice seven nights we sailed and sailed;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      At length I saw the bay
    </p>
    <p>
      Where I built my ship, and my mother's house'
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Mid the green hills where it lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell!" said I to the Nautilus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And leaped upon the shore;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou art a skilful mariner,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But I'll sail with thee no more!"

    <p>

    <p>
      And forth they pricked upon Routorr side,

    <p>
      As goodly a raid as a king could ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Proud Gwennivar rode like a queen of the land,

    <p>
      With page and with squire at her bridle hand;

    <p>
      And the twice six knights of the stony ring,

      They girded and guarded their Cornish king.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they halted their steeds at St Madron's cell:
    </p>
    <p>
      And they stood by the monk of the cloisteredwell;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now off with your gauntlets," King Arthur he cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And glory or shame for our Tamar side."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twere sooth to sing how Sir Gauvain smiled,

      Sir Bevis he touched and he found no fear:

      Now the fountain flashed o'er King Arthur's Queen

      THE THREE SAILORS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here were three
      sailors in Bristol city,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who took a boat and went to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But first with beef and captains' biscuit,
    </p>
    <p>
      And pickled pork they loaded she.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was guzzling Jack and gorging Jimmy,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the youngest he was little Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now very soon they were so greedy,
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn't leave not one split pea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Says guzzling Jack to gorging Jimmy,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am confounded hung-ery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Says gorging Jim to guzzling Jacky,
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no wittles, so we must eat we.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Says guzzling Jack to gorging Jimmy,
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! gorging Jim, what a fool you be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There's little Bill as is young and tender,
    </p>
    <p>
      We're old and tough&mdash;so let's eat <i>he</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! Bill, we're going to kill and eat you,
    </p>
    <p>
      So undo the collar of your chemie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bill he heard this information,
    </p>
    <p>
      He used his pocket-handkerchee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! let me say my catechism,
    </p>
    <p>
      As my poor mammy taught to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Make haste' make haste, says guzzling Jacky,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Jim pulled out his snicker-snee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bill went up the main top-gallant mast,
    </p>
    <p>
      When down he fell on his bended knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarce had said his catechism,
    </p>
    <p>
      When up he jumps; "There's land I see!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Jerusalem and Madagascar,
    </p>
    <p>
      And North and South <i>Ameri-key.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's the British fleet a-riding at anchor,
    </p>
    <p>
      With Admiral Napier, K.C.B."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So when they came to the Admiral's vessel,
    </p>
    <p>
      He hanged fat Jack, and flogged Jim <i>my.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for little Bill, he made him
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of a Seventy-three.

      HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      16&mdash;&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> sprang to the
      stirrup, and Joris, and he;
    </p>
    <p>
      I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good speed!" cried the watch, as the gate bolts undrew,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speed!" echoed the wall to us galloping through;
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
    </p>
    <p>
      Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
    </p>
    <p>
      Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Duffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;
    </p>
    <p>
      And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At Aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
      And against him the cattle stood black every one,
    </p>
    <p>
      To stare thro' the mist at us galloping past,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
    </p>
    <p>
      With resolute shoulders, each butting away
    </p>
    <p>
      The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
    </p>
    <p>
      For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;
    </p>
    <p>
      And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance
    </p>
    <p>
      O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon
    </p>
    <p>
      His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay spur!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well remember at Aix"&mdash;for one heard the quick wheeze
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,
    </p>
    <p>
      And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
    </p>
    <p>
      As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,
    </p>
    <p>
      Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;
    </p>
    <p>
      Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
    </p>
    <p>
      And "Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix- is in sight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "How they'll greet us!"&mdash;and all in a moment his roan
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,
    </p>
    <p>
      With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
    </p>
    <p>
      And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,
    </p>
    <p>
      Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
    </p>
    <p>
      Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse with out peer;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And all I remember is&mdash;friends flocking round
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;
    </p>
    <p>
      And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
    </p>
    <p>
      As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
    </p>
    <p>
      Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.

    <p class="indent5">
      twenty years ago

      As you'd look down a hatchway when standing

      on the deck.

      you can beat them now.

      Before he got inside the town he died, I must

      Then Farmer said, "I'll try, sir," and Farmer
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      bowed so low

      That George could see his pigtail tied in a velvet

      bow.

    <p>
      George gave him his commission, and that it

    <p>
      Signed "King of Britain, King of France," and

      sealed it with a wafer.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      his own,
    </p>
    <p>
      And grander on his quarter-deck than George

    <p class="indent5">
      upon the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      ten,
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored

      the fogs.

      <br />

      The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright

    <p class="indent5">
      with melting tar,
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      afar;
    </p>
    <p>
      The east wind drives three square-sailed masts
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      from out the Breton bay,

    <p>
      And "Clear for action!" Farmer shouts, and

      reefers yell "Hooray!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchmen's captain had a name I wish I
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      could pronounce;
    </p>
    <p>
      A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      from bounce,

    <p>
      One like those famous fellows who died by guil-

    </p>
    <p>
      The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,
    </p>
    <p>
      Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      smiths could forge;
    </p>
    <p>
      And both were simple seamen, but both could
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      understand
    </p>
    <p>
      How each was bound to win or die for flag and

    <p class="indent5">
      native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The French ship was la Surveillante, which means
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      the watchful maid;
    </p>
    <p>
      She folded up her head-dress and began to

    <p class="indent5">
      cannonade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      to spread more sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      On canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      came like hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sore smitten were both captains, and many lads
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      beside,
    </p>
    <p>
      And still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      blazing gun;
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not quench the rushing flames, and so
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      the Frenchman won.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      all aglow;
    </p>
    <p>
      Men hung upon the taffrail half scorched, but
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      loth to go;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our captain sat where once he stood, and would
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      not quit his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade his comrades leap for life, and leave
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      him bleeding there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The guns were hushed on either side, the French-
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      men lowered boats,
    </p>
    <p>
      They flung us planks and hencoops, and every-
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      thing that floats.
    </p>
    <p>
      They risked their lives, good fellows! to bring
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      their rivals aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas by the conflagration the peace was
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      strangely made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>La Surveillante</i> was like a sieve; the victors had
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      no rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to dodge the east wind to reach the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      port of Brest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And where the waves leapt lower, and the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      riddled ship went slower,
    </p>
    <p>
      In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      boats to tow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      for Farmer dead;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the wounded captives passed each Breton
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      bowed the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then spoke the French Lieutenant, "'Twas fire

      OLD SIR WALTER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>A Story of 1734.</i>)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>tout Sir Walter
      was old but hearty:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A velvet cap on his long grey hair,
    </p>
    <p>
      A full white rose at his gold-laced button:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Many were laughing, but none looked gayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a beast was his jet black hunter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Silver-spotted with foam and froth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Brawny in flank and fiery-blooded,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stung by the spur to a curbless wrath!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaily blowing his horn, he scrambled
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Over the stone wall four feet two;
    </p>
    <p>
      See saw over the old park railing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shaking the thistle-head rich with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A long black face the sour Whig huntsman
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Pulled, when he saw Sir Walter come
    </p>
    <p>
      Trotting up gay by the oak wood cover.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Why when he cheered did they all sit dumb?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Why when he flung up his hat and shouted,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "God save King George!" they bawling cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Justice, drawing a long-sealed parchment,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Rode up grim to Sir Walters side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "In King Georges name, arrest him, lieges!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      This is the villain who fought at Boyne:
    </p>
    <p>
      He sliced the feather from off my beaver,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And ran his sword twice into my groin."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out whipp'd blades: the horns they
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      sounded,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The field came flocking in thick and fast,
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Walter flogged at the barking rabble,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And through them all like a whirlwind passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred guineas to seize the traitor!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Cried the Justice, purple and white with rage,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then such a spurring, whipping, and flogging,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was never seen in the strangest age.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunter whipped off Spot and Fowler,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Viper and Fury, and all the pack,
    </p>
    <p>
      And set them fast, with their red tongues lolling
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And white teeth fix'd, on Sir Walter's track.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud on the wind came blast of bugle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All together the hounds gave tongue,
    </p>
    <p>
      They swept like a hail-storm down by the gibbet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where the black rags still in the cold storm
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain cut faces like long whip lashes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The wind blew strong in its wayward will,
    </p>
    <p>
      And powdering fast, the men and horses
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Thundering swept down Frampton Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There half the grooms at last pull'd bridle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Swearing'twould ruin their bits of blood;
    </p>
    <p>
      Three Whig rogues flew out of the saddle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And two were plumped in the river mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men stuck to the leading rebel;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The first was a Whig lord, fat and red,
    </p>
    <p>
      The next a yellow-faced lean attorney,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the last a Justice, as some one said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Slap at the fence went old Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Slap at the ditch by the pollard-tree,
    </p>
    <p>
      Crash through the hazels, over the water,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And wherever he went, there went the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the hill-fence broke Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Right through the tangle of branch and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      thorns,
    </p>
    <p>
      Swish'd the rasper up by the windmill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In spite of the cries and blowing of horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lines of flames trailed all the scarlet
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Streaming, the dogs half a mile before,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoop! with a cry all after Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Driving wildly along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the timber flew old Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Light as a swallow, sure and swift,
    </p>
    <p>
      For his sturdy arm and his "pull and hustle"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Could help a nag at the deadest lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Off went his gold-laced hat and bugle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His scarlet cloak he then let fall,
    </p>
    <p>
      And into the river spurr'd old Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Boldly there, in the sight of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was many a sore on back and wither,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Many a spur that ran with red,
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of them caught the stout Sir Walter,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Though they counted of horses sixty head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was many a fetlock cut and wounded,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Many a hock deep lam'd with thorns,
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a man that two years after
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shuddered to hear the sound of horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the fallow, the long clay fallow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Foundered his black mare, Lilly Lee,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir Walter sat on the tough old saddle,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Waiting the coming of all the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Never such chase of stag or vermin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Along the park pale, in and out;
    </p>
    <p>
      On they thundered, fast over the railing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Driving the fence in splints about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The first he shot with his long steel pistol,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The second he slew with his Irish sword,
    </p>
    <p>
      The third he threw in the brook, and mounted
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Quick on the steed of the fat Whig lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then off to the ship at the nearest harbour,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Gallop'd Sir Walter, sure and fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died, 'tis true, in an old French garret,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But his heart went true to the latest beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white rose, stifled and very sickly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Pined for air at the window-sill,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the last fond look of the brave old trooper
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Was fixed on the dying emblem&mdash;still,
    </p>
    <p>
      All alone in the dusky garret,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He turn d to the flower with a father's pride,
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save King James!" the old man mur-
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      mured,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "God&mdash;save&mdash;the&mdash;King!" he moaned and
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

      MAIDEN SONG
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ong ago and long
      ago,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And long ago still,
    </p>
    <p>
      There dwelt three merry maidens
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon a distant hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was tall Meggan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And one was dainty May,
    </p>
    <p>
      But one was fair Margaret,
    </p>
    <p>
      More fair than I can say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Long ago and long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And when May pulled the brier,
    </p>
    <p>
      Half the birds would swoop to see,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Half the beasts draw nigher;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half the fishes of the streams
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Would dart up to admire:
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or poppy hot aflame,
    </p>
    <p>
      All the beasts, and all the birds,
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the fishes came
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To her hand more soft than snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Strawberry leaves and May-dew
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In brisk morning air,
    </p>
    <p>
      Strawberry leaves and May-dew
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Make maidens fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go for strawberry leaves,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Meggan said one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair Margaret can bide at home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But you come with me, May;
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the hill and down the hill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Along the winding way
    </p>
    <p>
      You and I are used to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So these two fair sisters
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Went with innocent will
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the hill and down again,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And round the homestead hill:
    </p>
    <p>
      While the fairest sat at home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Margaret like a queen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a blush-rose, like the moon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In her heavenly sheen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fragrant-breathed as milky cow
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Or field of blossoming bean,
    </p>
    <p>
      Graceful as an ivy bough
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Born to cling and lean;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she sat to sing and sew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When she raised her lustrous eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A beast peeped at the door;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she downward cast her eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A fish gasped on the floor;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she turned away her eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A bird perched on the sill,
    </p>
    <p>
      Warbling out its heart of love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Warbling warbling still,
    </p>
    <p>
      With pathetic pleadings low.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Light-foot May with Meggan
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Sought the choicest spot,
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then, while day waxed hot,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sat at ease to play and rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A gracious rest and play;
    </p>
    <p>
      The loveliest maidens near or far,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When Margaret was away,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who sat at home to sing and sew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Wind-play tossed their hair,
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping things among the grass
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Stroked them here and there;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meggan piped a merry note,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A fitful wayward lay,
    </p>
    <p>
      While shrill as birds on topmost twig
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Piped merry May;
    </p>
    <p>
      Honey-smooth the double flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sped a herdsman from the vale,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Mounting like a flame,
    </p>
    <p>
      All on fire to hear and see,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With floating locks he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looked neither north nor south,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Neither east nor west,
    </p>
    <p>
      But sat him down at Meggan's feet
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As love-bird on his nest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And wooed her with a silent awe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With trouble not expressed;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang the tears into his eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The heart out of his breast:
    </p>
    <p>
      So he loved her, listening so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang the heart out of his breast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The words out of his tongue;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand and foot and pulse he paused
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till her song was sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke up from his place
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Simple words and true:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scanty goods have I to give,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Scanty skill to woo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have a will to work,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And a heart for you:
    </p>
    <p>
      Bid me stay or bid me go."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Meggan mused within herself:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "Better be first with him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who shines my brightness dim,
    </p>
    <p>
      For ever second where she sits,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      However fair I be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be lady of his love,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And he shall worship me;
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be lady of his herds
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And stoop to his degree,
    </p>
    <p>
      At home where kids and fatlings grow."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Goof^
    </p>
    <p>
      Sped a shepherd from the height
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Headlong down to look,
    </p>
    <p>
      (White lambs followed, lured by love
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of their shepherd's crook):
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned neither east nor west,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Neither north nor south,
    </p>
    <p>
      But knelt right down to May, for love
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of her sweet-singing mouth;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In parching hill-side drouth;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgot himself for weal or woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Trilled her song and swelled her song
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With maiden coy caprice
    </p>
    <p>
      In a labyrinth of throbs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Pauses, cadences;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear-noted as a dropping brook,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Soft-noted like the bees,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild-noted as the shivering wind
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Forlorn through forest trees:
    </p>
    <p>
      Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Who hides herself for love,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet cannot keep her secret safe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But coos and coos thereof:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the notes rang loud or low.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung breathless on her breath;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Speechless, who listened well;
    </p>
    <p>
      Could not speak or think or wish
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till silence broke the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke, and spread his hands,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Pointing here and there:
    </p>
    <p>
      "See my sheep and see the lambs,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Twin lambs which they bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And myself I offer you,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All my flocks and care,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sweet song hath moved me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In her fluttered heart young May
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Mused a dubious while,
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he loves me as he says"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Her lips curved with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where Margaret shines like the sun
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I shine but like a moon;
    </p>
    <p>
      If sister Meggan makes her choice
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I can make mine as soon;
    </p>
    <p>
      At cockcrow we were sister-maids,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      We may be brides at noon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Meggan, "Yes;" May said not "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Awhile she sang her song,
    </p>
    <p>
      Awhile sat silent, then she thought:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "My sisters loiter long."
    </p>
    <p>
      That sultry noon had waned away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Shadows had waxen great:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," she thought within herself,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "My sisters loiter late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and peered out at the door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With patient heart to wait,
    </p>
    <p>
      And heard a distant nightingale
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Complaining of its mate;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then down the garden slope she walked,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Down to the garden gate,
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaned on the rail and waited so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope was lightened by her eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Like summer lightning fair,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like rising of the haloed moon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Lightened her glimmering hair,
    </p>
    <p>
      While her face lightened like the sun
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Whose dawn is rosy white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus crowned with maiden majesty
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She peered into the night,
    </p>
    <p>
      Looked up the hill and down the hill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To left hand and to right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting thus in weariness
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      She marked the nightingale
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling, if any one would heed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Its old complaining tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then lifted she her voice and sang,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Answering the bird:
    </p>
    <p>
      Then lifted she her voice and sang,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Such notes were never heard
    </p>
    <p>
      From any bird when Spring's in blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The king of all that country,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Coursing far, coursing near,
    </p>
    <p>
      Curbed his amber-bitted steed
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Coursed amain to hear;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All his princes in his train,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Squire, and knight, and peer,
    </p>
    <p>
      With his crown upon his head,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His sceptre in his hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      Down he fell at Margaret's knees
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Lord king of all that land,
    </p>
    <p>
      To her highness bending low.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Every beast and bird and fish,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Came mustering to the sound,
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man and every maid
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From miles of country round:
    </p>
    <p>
      Meggan on her herdsman's arm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With her shepherd, May,
    </p>
    <p>
      Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Along the hill-side way;
    </p>
    <p>
      No foot too feeble for the ascent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Not any head too grey;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were swift, and none were slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So Margaret sang her sisters home
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In their marriage mirth;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang free birds out of the sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Beasts along the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang up fishes of the deep&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      All breathing things that move
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang from far and sang from near
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To her lovely love;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang together friend and foe;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang a golden-bearded king
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Straightway to her feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sang him silent where he knelt
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In eager anguish sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the clear voice died away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When longest echoes died,
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up like a royal man
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And claimed her for his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      So three maids were wooed and won
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a brief May-tide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago and long ago.

      LOVE FROM THE NORTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had a love in
      soft south land,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Beloved through April far in May;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited on my lightest breath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And never dared to say me nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He saddened if my cheer was sad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But gay he grew if I was gay;
    </p>
    <p>
      We never differed on a hair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      My yes his yes, my nay his nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding hour was come, the aisles
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were flushed with sun and flowers that day;
    </p>
    <p>
      I pacing balanced in my thoughts:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      "It's quite too late to think of nay."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My bridegroom answered in his turn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Myself had almost answered "Yea
    </p>
    <p>
      When through the flashing nave I heard
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A struggle and resounding "Nay,"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridesmaids and bridegroom shrank in fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But I stood high who stood at bay:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I answer yea, fair sir,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      What man art thou to bar with nay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a strong man from the north,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous grey:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put yea by for another time
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In which I will not say thee nay."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He took me in his strong white arms,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He bore me on his horse away
    </p>
    <p>
      O'er crag, morass, and hair-breadth pass,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But never asked me yea or nay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He made me fast with book and bell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With links of love he makes me stay;
    </p>
    <p>
      Till now I've neither heart nor power

      Nor will nor wish to say him nay.

    <p class="indent5">
      A-fiddling through the land,

    <p>
      And they fiddled a tune on their fiddles
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That none could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For none who heard their fiddling
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Might keep his ten toes still,
    </p>
    <p>
      E en the cripple threw down his crutches,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And danced against his will:
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and old they all fell a-dancing,

    <p class="indent5">
      While the fiddlers fiddled their fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They fiddled down to the ferry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The ferry by Severn-side,
    </p>
    <p>
      And they stept aboard the ferry,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      None else to row or guide,

    <p class="indent5">
      And stoutly the oars they plied.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly in the mid-channel
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      These fiddlers ceased to row,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the pilot spake to his fellows
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In a tongue that none may know:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us home to our fathers and brothers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the maidens we love below."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the fiddlers seized their fiddles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sang to their fiddles a song:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are coming, coming, oh brothers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To the home we have left so long,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the world still loves the fiddler,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the fiddler's tune is strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they stept from out the ferry
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Into the Severn-sea,
    </p>
    <p>
      Down into the depths of the waters
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Where the homes of the fiddlers be,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ferry-boat drifted slowly
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Forth to the ocean free!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But where those jolly fiddlers
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Walked down into the deep,
    </p>
    <p>
      The ripples are never quiet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But for ever dance and leap,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Severn-sea be silent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the winds be all asleep.

      SIR NICHOLAS AT MARSTON MOOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o horse, to horse,
      Sir Nicholas! the clarion's
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      note is high;
    </p>
    <p>
      To horse, to horse, Sir Nicholas! the big drum
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      makes reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere this hath Lucas marched with his gallant
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      cavaliers,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the bray of Rupert's trumpets grows
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      fainter on our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      To horse, to horse, Sir Nicholas! White Guy is
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      at the door,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the vulture whets his beak o'er the field of
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Marston Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Up rose the Lady Alice from her brief and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      broken prayer,
    </p>
    <p>
      And she brought a silken standard down the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      narrow turret stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, many were the tears that those radiant eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      had shed,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she worked the bright word "Glory"in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      gay and glancing thread;
    </p>
    <p>
      And mournful was the smile which o'er those
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      beauteous features ran,
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said, "It is your lady's gift; unfurl it in
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      the van."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall flutter, noble wench, where the best
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      and boldest ride,
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the steel-clad files of Skippon, and the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      black dragoons of Pride;
    </p>
    <p>
      The recreant soul of Fairfax will feel a sicklier
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      qualm,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the rebel lips of Oliver give out a louder
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      psalm,
    </p>
    <p>
      When they see my lady's gew-gaw flaunt
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      bravely on their wing,
    </p>
    <p>
      And hear her loyal soldier's shout, For God and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      for the King!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis noon; the ranks are broken along the
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      royal line;
    </p>
    <p>
      They fly, the braggarts of the Court, the bullies
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      of the Rhine:
    </p>
    <p>
      Stout Langley's cheer is heard no more, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Astley's helm is down,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rupert sheathes his rapier with a curse and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      with a frown;
    </p>
    <p>
      And cold Newcastle mutters, as he follows in
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      the flight,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The German boar had better far have supped
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      in York to-night.''
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight is all alone, his steel cap cleft in
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      twain,
    </p>
    <p>
      His good buff jerkin crimsoned o'er with many
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      a gory stain;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet still he waves the standard, and cries amid
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      the rout&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Church and King, fair gentlemen, spur
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      on and fight it out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he wards a Roundhead's pike, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      now he hums a stave,
    </p>
    <p>
      And here he quotes a stage-play, and there he
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      fells a knave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Good speed to thee, Sir Nicholas! thou hast
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      no thought of fear;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good speed to thee, Sir Nicholas! but fearful
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      odds are here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traitors ring thee round, and with every
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      blow and thrust,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down, down," they cry, "with Belial, down
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      with him to the dust!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," quoth grim old Oliver, "that
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Belial's trusty sword
    </p>
    <p>
      This day were doing battle for the Saints and

      The lady Alice sits with her maidens in her

    <p class="indent5">
      bower;
    </p>
    <p>
      The grey-haired warden watches on the castle's

      highest tower.&mdash;

    <p>
      "What news, what news, old Anthony?"&mdash;

    <p class="indent5">
      "The field is lost and won;
